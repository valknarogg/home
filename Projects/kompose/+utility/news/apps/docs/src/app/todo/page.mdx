# What's next?

LetterSpace is a work in progress, with many features yet to be implemented.

Here are some of the planned features:

- [ ] Clean ups
- [ ] Teams
- [ ] Webhooks
- [ ] SMTP Feedback

## Clean Ups

Currently, LetterSpace does not have a clean up mechanism for old data such as sent messages, which can clutter your database.

We'll implement a clean up mechanism that will automatically delete old messages based on disk usage thresholds or after a specified retention period.

## Teams

Teams will allow you to manage other users in your organization. As an administrator, you'll be able to create, update and delete teams.

## Webhooks

Webhooks will allow you to integrate LetterSpace with your existing infrastructure. You'll be able to subscribe to events and receive notifications securely when specific actions take place.

## SMTP Feedback

SMTP Feedback will enable LetterSpace to receive updates directly from SMTP servers regarding message delivery status. This feature will capture and process bounce notifications, delivery failures, and other email delivery issues, allowing you to monitor email performance and troubleshoot delivery problems in real-time.
