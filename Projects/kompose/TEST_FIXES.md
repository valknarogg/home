# Test Suite Fixes

## Issues Identified

After analyzing all test suites and the kompose.sh modules, I've identified the following issues:

### 1. Missing Functions in kompose-setup.sh
The setup commands are missing in the codebase.

### 2. Missing Functions in kompose-profile.sh  
The profile commands are missing in the codebase.

### 3. Missing Functions in kompose-secrets.sh
The secrets commands are missing in the codebase.

### 4. Missing Functions in kompose-tag.sh
The tag validation function is missing.

### 5. Missing Functions in kompose-db.sh
The database commands are missing in the codebase.

### 6. Inconsistent Error Messages
Some tests expect specific error messages that don't match the actual output.

## Fixes Applied

All missing module functions will be implemented to match the test expectations.
