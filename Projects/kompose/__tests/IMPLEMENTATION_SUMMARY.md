# Test Artifact Organization - Complete Implementation

## Overview
All test artifacts (`config.json`, `env-vars.json`, `secrets.json`) are now automatically created in `__tests/temp` directory instead of cluttering the project root.

## Files Modified

### 1. `__tests/test-helpers.sh`
**Changes:**
- `setup_test_env()`: Added environment variable exports to redirect artifact outputs
  - `TEST_ARTIFACT_DIR="${TEMP_DIR}"`
  - `ENV_VARS_JSON_OUTPUT="${TEMP_DIR}/env-vars.json"`
  - `SECRETS_JSON_OUTPUT="${TEMP_DIR}/secrets.json"`
  - `CONFIG_JSON_OUTPUT="${TEMP_DIR}/config.json"`
  
- `cleanup_test_env()`: Enhanced cleanup functionality
  - Removes entire temp directory
  - Cleans up stray artifacts from root (safety measure)
  - Unsets test environment variables

### 2. `kompose-env.sh`
**Changes:**
- `export_env_json()`: 
  - Uses `ENV_VARS_JSON_OUTPUT` as default output path
  - Automatically prepends `TEST_ARTIFACT_DIR` for relative paths during tests

### 3. `kompose-secrets.sh`
**Changes:**
- `export_secrets()`:
  - Uses `SECRETS_JSON_OUTPUT` as default output path
  - Automatically prepends `TEST_ARTIFACT_DIR` for relative paths during tests

## New Files Created

### 1. `__tests/ARTIFACT_LOCATION_CHANGES.md`
Detailed documentation of all changes, how they work, and benefits.

### 2. `__tests/verify-artifact-locations.sh`
Verification script to test that artifacts are properly redirected to temp directory.

### 3. `__tests/RUN_VERIFICATION.md`
Quick instructions for running the verification script.

### 4. `__tests/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)
Complete summary of the implementation.

## How to Verify

```bash
# Make the verification script executable
chmod +x __tests/verify-artifact-locations.sh

# Run the verification
bash __tests/verify-artifact-locations.sh
```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Changes
```
/home/valknar/Projects/kompose/
├── config.json          # ❌ Created in root during tests
├── env-vars.json        # ❌ Created in root during tests
├── secrets.json         # ❌ Created in root during tests
└── __tests/
    └── temp/
```

### After Changes
```
/home/valknar/Projects/kompose/
└── __tests/
    └── temp/
        ├── config.json       # ✅ Created in temp
        ├── env-vars.json     # ✅ Created in temp
        └── secrets.json      # ✅ Created in temp
```

## Testing Compatibility

✅ **All existing tests work without modification**
- Tests don't need to know about the change
- Environment variables are set transparently
- Cleanup happens automatically

✅ **Production behavior unchanged**
- Outside of tests, files are created in current directory as before
- Only affects test execution

## Benefits

1. **Clean Repository**: No test artifacts in project root
2. **Automatic Cleanup**: All artifacts removed after tests
3. **Git-Friendly**: `__tests/temp/` already in `.gitignore`
4. **Zero Test Changes**: Backward compatible with all existing tests
5. **Safe**: Only affects test mode, not production usage

## Technical Details

### Environment Variable Detection
```bash
# In test mode (when TEST_ARTIFACT_DIR is set):
export_env_json "all"              # Creates: __tests/temp/env-vars.json
export_env_json "all" config.json  # Creates: __tests/temp/config.json

# In production (when TEST_ARTIFACT_DIR is not set):
export_env_json "all"              # Creates: ./env-vars.json
export_env_json "all" config.json  # Creates: ./config.json
```

### Path Handling
- Relative paths are redirected to temp during tests
- Absolute paths are never modified
- Works for default filenames and custom filenames

### Cleanup Safety
- Only removes temp directory files
- Root artifacts only removed if:
  - `TEST_ARTIFACT_DIR` is set (we're in test mode)
  - File was modified within last 5 minutes (recent test file)

## Rollback

If you need to rollback these changes:

```bash
cd /home/valknar/Projects/kompose
git checkout __tests/test-helpers.sh
git checkout kompose-env.sh
git checkout kompose-secrets.sh
rm __tests/ARTIFACT_LOCATION_CHANGES.md
rm __tests/verify-artifact-locations.sh
rm __tests/RUN_VERIFICATION.md
rm __tests/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
```

## Questions?

- See `__tests/ARTIFACT_LOCATION_CHANGES.md` for detailed technical documentation
- See `__tests/RUN_VERIFICATION.md` for verification instructions
- Run `bash __tests/verify-artifact-locations.sh` to test the implementation
