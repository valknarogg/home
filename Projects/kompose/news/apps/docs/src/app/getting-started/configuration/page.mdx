# Configuring LetterSpace

LetterSpace leverages the SMTP protocol to send newsletters to your audience so, you'll need to have an SMTP server set up already.

The easiest way to have a fully functional SMTP server ready is by using [Resend](https://resend.com). Create an account and connect your domain; you'll have an SMTP server ready in minutes.

## Configuration

Before being able to send newsletters, you'll need to configure the SMTP server details.

### SMTP Server Details

To connect to your SMTP server, you'll need a few details:

- **SMTP Host**: E.g. `smtp.resend.com`
- **SMTP Port**: E.g. `465`
- **SMTP Username**: E.g. `resend`
- **SMTP Password**: E.g. `re_...`
- **From Email**: Email address that will appear as the sender
- **From Name**: Name that will appear as the sender
- **Secure**: Whether to use secure connection (default: true)
- **Encryption**: Connection encryption type (STARTTLS, SSL_TLS, or NONE)
- **Timeout**: Connection timeout in milliseconds (default: 30000)

Go to the settings menu and fill in the details with your SMTP server details.

### Email Delivery Settings

You can configure various email delivery parameters to optimize your newsletter sending:

- **Rate Limit**: Maximum number of emails that can be sent within the rate window (default: 100)
- **Rate Window**: Time window in seconds for the rate limit (default: 3600)
- **Max Retries**: Number of retry attempts for failed email deliveries (default: 3)
- **Retry Delay**: Delay in seconds between retry attempts (default: 300)
- **Concurrency**: Number of simultaneous email sending operations (default: 5)
- **Connection Timeout**: SMTP connection timeout in milliseconds (default: 30000)

These settings can be adjusted in the Email Delivery Settings section of your dashboard to match your SMTP provider's requirements and your sending needs.

### API Keys

API keys allow you to interact with the newsletter system programmatically. You can manage your API keys in the API Keys section of the dashboard. Each API key includes:

- A unique key identifier
- Name for the key
- Creation date
- Expiration date (optional)
- Last used timestamp

Keep your API keys secure and rotate them regularly. You can create multiple API keys for different integrations and revoke them individually if needed.
