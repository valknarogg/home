# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up LetterSpace quickly on your own infrastructure.

## Installation

We've made LetterSpace for simplicity and ease of use. The easiest way to get started is by using `docker-compose`.

### Using Docker Compose

1.  **Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file:**

    Create a file named `docker-compose.yaml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    services:
      db:
        image: postgres:17 # Use your preferred Postgres version
        restart: always
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: user # Change to a secure user
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password # Change to a secure password
          POSTGRES_DB: letterspace
        volumes:
          - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
        networks:
          - app_network

      backend:
        # For Bun runtime
        image: ghcr.io/dcodesdev/letterspace:bun
        # For NodeJS runtime
        # image: ghcr.io/dcodesdev/letterspace:node
        pull_policy: always
        restart: always
        depends_on:
          - db
        ports:
          - "5000:5000" # Expose backend on port 5000
        environment:
          # Make sure this matches the db service credentials
          DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://user:password@db:5432/letterspace?schema=public"
          JWT_SECRET: your_super_secret_jwt_key # Change to a secure secret
        networks:
          - app_network

    volumes:
      postgres_data:
        driver: local

    networks:
      app_network:
        driver: bridge
    ```

<Callout type="warning">
  Replace <code>POSTGRES_USER</code>, <code>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</code>, and{" "}
  <code>JWT_SECRET</code> with your own secure values before running.
</Callout>

2.  **Run Docker Compose:**

    Navigate to the directory where you saved the `docker-compose.yaml` file and run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

That's it! LetterSpace backend should now be running and accessible on port `5000` of your host machine.

You can access the LetterSpace dashboard directly at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) if running locally, or proceed to set up a reverse proxy.

## Reverse Proxy (Optional)

If you don't already have a reverse proxy, you can follow along.

To access the LetterSpace dashboard securely via a domain name (e.g., `https://letterspace.yourdomain.com`), you can use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy.

We'll use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) as an example. Caddy is easy to use and automatically manages SSL certificates.

### Install Caddy on Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https curl
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install caddy
```

For other Linux distributions, check the [official Caddy installation documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install).

### DNS Configuration

Configure your domain's DNS records. Add an `A` record pointing your desired subdomain (e.g., `newsletter`) to the public IP address of your server.

### Configure Caddy

Create or edit Caddy's configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

Add the following configuration:

```bash
letterspace.yourdomain.com { # Replace with your actual domain
    reverse_proxy localhost:5000
}
```

> Replace `letterspace.yourdomain.com` with your actual domain. Caddy will automatically provision an SSL certificate for it.

### Start Caddy

Restart Caddy to apply your changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart caddy
```

Check the status to ensure it's running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status caddy
```

Wait a minute or two for Caddy to provision the SSL certificate, then access the LetterSpace dashboard securely at `https://letterspace.yourdomain.com`.
