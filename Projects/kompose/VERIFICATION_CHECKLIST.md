# Custom Stack Management Implementation - Verification Checklist

## Overview

This document provides a systematic verification procedure to confirm that the custom stack management enhancements function correctly across all operational scenarios. Following these verification steps ensures that the implementation meets design specifications and operates reliably in production environments.

## Pre-Verification Requirements

Before beginning verification procedures, ensure the following prerequisites are satisfied. The Kompose project directory must contain at least one custom stack in the `+custom` directory to enable meaningful testing. The core platform components should be operational to validate integration features. The `kompose.sh` script must have appropriate execution permissions to enable command invocation.

## Verification Procedures

### Stack Discovery Verification

Execute the list command to confirm that custom stacks have been discovered and registered correctly. The command output should display separate sections for built-in stacks and custom stacks, with appropriate color differentiation and status information for each stack.

```bash
./kompose.sh list
```

Expected outcomes include the appearance of all custom stacks from the `+custom` directory under the "Custom Stacks" section header. Each custom stack entry should include a description extracted from configuration files or display the generic "Custom stack" designation if no specific description is available. Status information showing the ratio of running containers to total services should appear for each stack.

### Stack Existence Validation

Verify that the stack validation mechanism correctly identifies custom stacks across both potential locations. This test confirms that the fallback logic operates correctly when locating stacks.

```bash
# Test with existing custom stack
./kompose.sh status blog

# Test with non-existent stack
./kompose.sh status nonexistent
```

The first command should execute successfully and display status information for the custom stack. The second command should fail with appropriate error messaging indicating which locations were searched and that the stack was not found in either location.

### Stack Lifecycle Operations

Validate that standard lifecycle management commands function correctly on custom stacks. These tests confirm that start, stop, and restart operations execute properly and that Docker Compose receives correct configuration.

```bash
# Start custom stack
./kompose.sh up blog

# Verify stack is running
./kompose.sh status blog

# Restart custom stack
./kompose.sh restart blog

# Stop custom stack
./kompose.sh down blog
```

Each command should complete successfully without errors. The status command should reflect the current operational state of the stack. Container logs should show normal startup and shutdown sequences without configuration errors.

### Environment Configuration Validation

Confirm that environment variable resolution operates correctly for custom stacks. This verification ensures that generated environment files contain appropriate configuration values and that Docker Compose can access necessary variables.

```bash
# Generate environment and check output
./kompose.sh up blog
cat +custom/blog/.env.generated
```

The generated environment file should contain all necessary variables including stack-specific configuration, database connection parameters, Traefik host variables, and domain configuration. Variable values should resolve correctly without placeholder text or undefined references.

### Logging and Monitoring Operations

Verify that logging commands correctly access container logs from custom stacks. This confirms that the path resolution logic functions properly across all operational commands.

```bash
# View logs for custom stack
./kompose.sh logs blog --tail 50

# Follow logs in real-time
./kompose.sh logs blog -f
# Press Ctrl+C to stop following logs
```

Log output should display container logs from the custom stack without errors. The follow mode should show real-time log updates as services generate new log entries.

### Image Management Validation

Confirm that image-related operations function correctly on custom stacks. These tests validate that pull, build, and deploy commands correctly identify and operate on custom stack images.

```bash
# Pull latest images
./kompose.sh pull blog

# If stack contains buildable images
./kompose.sh build sexy

# Verify images exist
docker images | grep blog
docker images | grep sexy
```

Pull operations should download the latest versions of referenced images from configured registries. Build operations should successfully compile custom images according to Dockerfile specifications. Image listings should reflect updated tag information following these operations.

### Container Execution Validation

Verify that container execution commands correctly target custom stack containers. This confirms that the system can locate and interact with running containers from custom stacks.

```bash
# Start the custom stack
./kompose.sh up blog

# Execute command in container
./kompose.sh exec blog ls -la /public

# Open interactive shell (if applicable)
./kompose.sh exec blog sh
# Execute commands in shell, then exit
```

Execution commands should successfully run within the targeted container and return appropriate output. Interactive shells should provide full command execution capabilities within the container environment.

### Database Integration Verification

For custom stacks requiring database connectivity, verify that database operations function correctly. This includes database creation, backup, and restore operations.

```bash
# Create database for custom stack (if needed)
./kompose.sh db exec -d postgres "CREATE DATABASE sexy;"

# Verify database exists
./kompose.sh db status

# Create backup of custom stack database
./kompose.sh db backup -d sexy

# List available backups
./kompose.sh db list
```

Database operations should execute successfully with appropriate confirmation messages. Backup files should appear in the designated backup directory with correct naming conventions and timestamps.

### Help Documentation Validation

Verify that the help system correctly displays custom stacks alongside built-in stacks with appropriate differentiation.

```bash
./kompose.sh help | grep -A 20 "BUILT-IN STACKS"
./kompose.sh help | grep -A 20 "CUSTOM STACKS"
```

The help output should include separate sections for built-in and custom stacks. Custom stack entries should appear in the custom stacks section with correct formatting and descriptions.

## Regression Testing

### Existing Stack Compatibility

Verify that existing built-in stacks continue to function correctly following the implementation of custom stack management capabilities. Test several representative built-in stacks to confirm that no operational regressions have occurred.

```bash
# Test core stack operations
./kompose.sh status core
./kompose.sh logs core --tail 20

# Test proxy stack operations
./kompose.sh status proxy
```

All commands should function identically to their pre-enhancement behavior. No new errors or warnings should appear during standard operations on built-in stacks.

### Environment Variable Resolution

Confirm that environment variable inheritance and resolution continue to function correctly for built-in stacks. This ensures that the path resolution enhancements do not introduce configuration issues.

```bash
# Check environment for built-in stack
./kompose.sh up core
cat core/.env.generated
```

Generated environment files for built-in stacks should contain all expected variables with correct values. No variables should show undefined values or incorrect resolution.

## Performance Validation

### Discovery Performance

Measure the discovery process performance to ensure it does not introduce significant startup delays. The discovery mechanism should execute quickly even with numerous custom stacks.

```bash
time ./kompose.sh list
```

The command should complete within reasonable time constraints (typically under two seconds for typical deployments with fewer than twenty total stacks). Discovery overhead should remain minimal and not significantly impact command responsiveness.

### Operation Performance

Verify that stack operations execute with performance characteristics similar to pre-enhancement behavior. Path resolution logic should not introduce measurable delays in standard operations.

```bash
time ./kompose.sh status blog
time ./kompose.sh logs blog --tail 100
```

Performance should remain consistent with built-in stack operations. No significant delays should be observed compared to pre-enhancement baseline measurements.

## Documentation Verification

### Documentation Completeness

Verify that all documentation files have been created and contain comprehensive information. This includes the technical architecture document, implementation summary, and individual stack documentation files.

```bash
ls -la CUSTOM_STACK_MANAGEMENT.md
ls -la IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
ls -la _docs/content/5.stacks/+custom/blog.md
ls -la _docs/content/5.stacks/+custom/sexy.md
ls -la _docs/content/5.stacks/+custom/index.md
```

All documentation files should exist with reasonable file sizes indicating substantial content. Documentation should follow established formatting conventions and provide clear, comprehensive information.

### Documentation Accuracy

Review documentation content to confirm that technical descriptions accurately reflect the implementation. Code examples should be executable and produce expected results.

Randomly select code examples from documentation files and execute them to verify accuracy. All commands should work as documented without requiring modifications or adjustments.

## Issue Resolution

### Common Discovery Issues

If custom stacks do not appear in listings, verify that stack directories contain correctly named compose files. The file must be named exactly `compose.yaml` rather than alternative naming schemes. Ensure that stack directories do not have names matching exclusion patterns like README.md or .gitkeep.

### Environment Configuration Issues

If environment variables do not resolve correctly, verify that the root `.env` file exists and contains appropriate configuration values. Check that the `domain.env` and `secrets.env` files are present and properly formatted. Review generated `.env.generated` files for error messages or warning indicators.

### Operation Failures

If stack operations fail unexpectedly, verify that Docker and Docker Compose are installed and accessible. Confirm that the kompose network exists or create it manually if necessary. Check container logs for service-specific errors that may not relate to the management infrastructure.
