# ENV File Corruption Fix

## Problem
Running `./kompose.sh up` or sourcing `.env` caused error:
```
line 340: AUTH: command not found
```

## Root Cause
The `.env` file had corrupted content on lines 340-342:
```bash
# Invalid syntax - tries to execute "AUTH" as a command
AUTH CHAIN CODE CORE HOME KMPS LINK MESSAGING PROXY TRACK VAULT VPN WATCH BLOG NEWS SEXY_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=auth chain code core home kmps link messaging proxy track vault vpn watch blog news sexy
```

This corruption also existed in the `.env.local` template file.

## Fix Applied

1. **Replaced `.env`** with clean local development configuration
2. **Fixed `.env.local`** by removing corrupted lines at the end

## Verification

Test that the fix works:

```bash
# Source the file (should not show any errors)
source .env

# Check a variable is set
echo $CORE_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME
# Should output: core

# Try running kompose
./kompose.sh up core
```

## Files Fixed

- âœ… `.env` - Replaced with clean configuration
- âœ… `.env.local` - Removed corrupted content from end of file

## What's in Your Clean .env File Now

- All COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME variables for all stacks
- Local development settings (localhost URLs)
- Service configurations (images, ports, etc.)
- Database connections (localhost for local dev)
- No corrupted bash syntax

## You Can Now Run

```bash
# All these should work without errors:
./kompose.sh up core
./kompose.sh up auth
./kompose.sh up kmps
./kompose.sh status
```

Your environment is now clean and ready to use! ðŸŽ‰
