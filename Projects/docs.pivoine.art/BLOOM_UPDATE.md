# 🌸 Bloom Animation Update Complete!

The Pivoine Docs icon has been updated with a beautiful **bud-to-bloom** animation!

## ✨ What Changed

### Before
The icon was always in a **fully bloomed state** with subtle animations:
- All petals visible at full size
- Documents visible in center
- Continuous pulsing and orbiting effects

### After
The icon now starts as a **closed bud** and blooms on hover:
- 🌱 **Initial state**: Compact closed bud (mysterious, inviting)
- 🌸 **Hover state**: Beautiful sequential bloom animation
- 🎯 **Click state**: Celebration with 3D rotation and effects

## 🎭 The Bloom Sequence

When you hover over the icon:

```
0.0s: Outer petals begin blooming outward
      ↓
0.1s: Middle petals join the bloom
      ↓
0.2s: Inner petals complete the flower
      ↓
0.3s: Center documents reveal
      ↓
0.4-0.8s: Text lines draw in one by one
      ↓
~1.0s: Full bloom - everything glowing!
```

**Duration**: ~1 second for complete bloom
**Easing**: Cubic-bezier with bounce effect
**Performance**: 60 FPS, GPU accelerated

## 🎨 Visual States

### Closed Bud (Initial) 🌱
```
   Petals: 30-50% size, tucked inward
  Opacity: 50-70%
Sparkles: Dim (30% opacity)
Particles: Slow orbit (12s)
    Pages: Hidden
     Text: Hidden
```

### Full Bloom (Hover) 🌸
```
   Petals: 100% size, fully open
  Opacity: 85-95%
Sparkles: Bright (100% opacity)
Particles: Fast orbit (8s)
    Pages: Visible, fanned out
     Text: All lines visible
```

## 🎯 Why This Change?
